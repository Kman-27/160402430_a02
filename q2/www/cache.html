    <p id="p1"> Cache </p>
    <p id="p2">Browser cache is the data downloaded and temporarily stored in a computer for a specific website upon initially visiting it. Some examples of data stored include web documents like HTML pages or images. This form of temporary storage improves the user experience as it allows webpages to load quicker and also reduce bandwidth usage overall.</p>

    <p id="p1"> Cookies </p>
    <p id="p2"> Cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored on a computer to keep track of user preferences. This can be useful when visiting a webpage and entering your username and password so that then next time you visit the same page the cookies stored would remember that information and automatically fill in the information. Other forms of cookies can be the memory stored of an IP Address, date and time of user visiting a site, or even just webpage preferences on a specific site such as Amazon remembering what you had added to your shopping cart. Clearing the cookies on one's browser results in the "clearing and resetting" of the webpages that had cookies stored. Clearing of cookies is generally done when new the user wishes to enter new information on a specific site to avoid any errors. The computer is told to forget any previous activities, settings and data overall. </p>
    <p id="p2"> With respect to the MailChimp form, the webpage stores the information of the form in its temporary memory so upon initially visiting the site, the form pops up. However if one wishes to make changes to the form or to just make the form pop up again on the webpage the cookies must be cleared to essentially allow the webpage to "refresh" or forget any previous data that was stored of the MailChimp form data. </p>
