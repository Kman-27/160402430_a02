    <p id="p2"> Professor Alan Turing, also known as the Father of Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence, was widely renowned for his contribution during World War 2 by intercepting coded messages exchanged between Nazi Germans and their Navy to communicate attacks on the Allies. Turing was successful by using his knowledge of cryptology to crack the code generated by an electromechanical messaging machine designed by the Germans called Enigma. In doing so, he was able to save the lives of millions and helped turn the war in favor of the Allies. His fields of expertise consisted of a vast range of subjects including mathematics, computer science, cryptology, and theoretical biology. In this Web Design course, Dr. Turing will be disussing topics such as: UI/UX Design, Bootstrap, and Responsive Web Design.</p>
