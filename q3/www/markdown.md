#Biology

##An Honors degree in Biology at WLU incorporates different foundational sciences into one program. Some of the subjects in the sciences include: Chemistry, Physic, and Mathematics. My particular interests involve the study of the microscopic world which is the study of microbiology. The Biology program aims to combine these theoretical fundamental concepts and apply them in laboratory settings which allows us students to gain hands-on experience while working with specific machines or tools found in a laboratory setting.
